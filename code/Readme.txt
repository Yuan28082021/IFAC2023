Here are short usage of the code for paper H2 suboptimal leader-follower consensus control of multi-agent systems
>>leader_follower_h2.m uses our designed protocols
>>leader_follower_paper_li.m uses the protocol from cited paper <“Cooperative control of multiagent systems: a consensus region approach”>
>>plot_leader_follower.m is used for plot trajectory

1. Run leader_follower_h2.m (or leader_follower_paper_li.m) in Matlab
2. Then open leader_follower.slx (or leader_follower_paperli.slx) and simulate it
3. Run plot_leader_follower.m to generate the trajectory
